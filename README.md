Site templates for SA public schools.
Just out here having fun creating static websites for public schools in my community. I used templates that Claude AI made for me and tweaked them and added to them for specific schools needs and attributes and made them mobile-responsive.

## Steps to run on your local machine.
1. Download the files
2. Go to VSCode and go to files and open folder.
3. Look for the downloaded files or where you saved them
4. Click and choose the folder that has everything.
5. open any of the html files and right-click on the code space.
6. choose open in default browser (You are done for desktop site) / open live server (for mobile version, follow steps below)
7. to view on mobile, connect to same wifi network as your machine
8. in your vscode type ctrl+` and in the terminal type "ipconfig" on windows
9. look for ipv4 and type that number in your browser followed by ":" and the port number your live server is serving, with no spaces in between

## Notes
- Add more sites.
