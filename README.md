Site templates for SA public schools.
Just out here having fun creating static websites for public schools in my community. I used templates that Claude AI made for me and tweaked them and added to them for specific schools needs and attributes and made them mobile-responsive.

## Steps to run on your local machine.
1. Download or clone the repository the files
2. Go to VSCode and go to Files -> Open folder.
3. Look for the downloaded files or where you saved them
4. Click the project folder ** ensure you clicked it once when you chose it.
5. Open any of the html (.html) files and right-click on the code.
6. Choose open in default browser (You are done for desktop site) / Download Live Server **(for mobile version, follow steps below)
## To see website on your mobile phone
7. Connect to same wifi network as your machine
8. Do step 6, choose Open live server/ Click "Go Live" at the bottom right of your screen
9. In your vscode type (Ctrl+`) and in the terminal type "ipconfig" on Windows
10. Look for IPv4 and type that number in your browser followed by ":" and the port number your live server is serving, with no spaces in between
- Type <IPv4>:<Port> in your browser. Example http://192.168.1.5:5500 or 192.168.1.5:5500

## Notes
- Add more sites.
- Improve templates as I learn more frontend magic 😎
